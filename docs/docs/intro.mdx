# Asxnc introduction

Asxnc (pronounced the same as async) is a collection of primitives for async
ts programming. This library complements standard web APIs and builds upon them.

## Why Asxnc?

- Wide range of async utilities
- Small footprint (~2KB uncompressed)
- Zero dependencies
- Uses promises, async iterables and async iterators

:::warning

This library provides low-level primitives which may introduce **deadlocks** to
your application. Promises are usually constructed in such way that deadlocks
are impossible, this library does not do that and provides APIs which returns
promises which may hang forever if not resolved explicitly (e.g. [lock()](/docs/synchronization/lock)).

:::

## Install

```sh
npm i asxnc

pnpm i asxnc

yarn add axnc
```

## Labeled tuples

resulting values as properties. //todo: vieme popisat use namiesto implementacie?

```ts
import { asxnc } from "asxnc";

// as tuple
const [iterator, dispatch] = asnxc.queue();

// as object
const { iterator, dispatch } = asnxc.queue();
```

This is useful when exporting values created by those functions.

```ts
// userQueue.ts
import { asxnc } from "asxnc";

export const userQueue = asxnc.queue();

// index.ts
import { userQueue } from "./userQueue";

userQueue.dispatch({ id: 3, username: "Jeff" });
```
